Another milestone for our community has been reached: in collaboration with [*FreeGameDev*](https://forum.freegamedev.net), we now offer a good ol' forum for discussions around Blue Nebula. Our community can ask questions, share maps and mods or propose ideads to the development team.

## Who is FreeGameDev?

[*FreeGameDev*](https://forum.freegamedev.net), along with [*Free Gamer*](https://freegamer.blogspot.com/) and a few other services (including a chat, a Wiki, and a lot more), is a global community around the world of free/open-source games. Many games have started their communities there, including [*Red Eclipse*](https://redeclipse.net).

In order to avoid having to deal with legal questions in this early state of the project, we asked *FreeGameDev* whether they were willing to provide us with a subforum. This way, we can provide our community with a classic forum, where ideas and user content can be shared, tournaments be organized, clans be founded, matches be reviewed and so much more. Last weekend, the team member *Julius* had time to set up [our Blue Nebula subforum](https://forum.freegamedev.net/viewforum.php?f=101) and three subforums therein.


## Organization

It's easier to separate the discussion area for development (e.g., GitHub issues) from the regular community discussion, as this allows the developers to work efficiently. We offer a development forum, where features can be proposed more easily (of course, GitHub issues are welcome, but some people don't have an account or don't want to sign up there), a Maps & Mods forum where users can present their creations, and a general discussion area which is responsible for all other topics.


## Thanks, FreeGameDev!

We thank *FreeGameDev* for hosting our community, and especially *Julius* for taking care of our request. We're honored to be a "featured project", and are looking forward to a productive and successful time.
