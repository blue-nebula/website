We have redesigned the serverbrowser to be more clean-looking without removing any features. We achieved this by moving many options that were previously in the serverbrowser itself, to it's own tab in the User Interface options.

As you can see in the screenshot above, we also added the option to 
**Hide Incompatible Servers** from the Serverbrowser list.
