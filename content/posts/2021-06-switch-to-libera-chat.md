We used to have a public IRC channel on the freenode network. Due to the [hostile takeover](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/freenode-irc-has-been-taken-over-by-the-crown-prince-of-korea/) which happened recently, we switched to the new [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat) network that is run by the former staff that was forced out.

Fortunately, we had finished our move already before the second wave of hostile behavior of the "new management", including the [forceful takeover of hundreds of channels](https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/26/freenode_irc_takeover/) that intended to move to other networks.

Any Blue Nebula channel on freenode is unofficial and not maintained by us. Please be aware that most of us deleted their accounts on freenode, so should you encounter someone using one of the teams' nicks, they're likely imposters. You can find us on the new network.
