We made quite a few changes to the main menu buttons like:  
- Align them to the left
- Add icons next to them to improve accessibility
- Coloring them
- Making the font bigger
- Changing their labels

By making the **Play Online** button big and green we want to help newbies that don't understand english, so they can still find their way to the server browser.
