Today we proudly announce the game Blue Nebula. Blue Nebula is a fork of [Red Eclipse 1](http://redeclipse.net) and can be seen as a continuation of its development.

<!--more-->

It is built by a team of eager community members who don't like some design decisions in Red Eclipse 2, which is based on a new engine which is very resource heavy and changes a lot of the gameplay mechanics we all like so much.
